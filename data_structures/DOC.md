# Data Structures

## Permutations of n and 0
----------

- [Source code](data_structures/permutations_of_n&0.cpp)

- Take `x` and `n` from the user as input.

- This program basically displays all the possible permutations of the number `x` and `0` having `n` number of digits. It makes use of the `queue` data-structure for evaluating the permutations.
