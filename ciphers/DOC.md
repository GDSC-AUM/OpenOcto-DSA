#  Ciphers
### A cipher (or cypher) is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryption—a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure. An alternative, less common term is encipherment. To encipher or encode is to convert information into cipher or code. In common parlance, “cipher” is synonymous with “code“, as they are both a set of steps that encrypt a message; however, the concepts are distinct in cryptography, especially classical cryptography.

# Caesar Ciphers
### Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.


# Solutions
#### The following programs uses Caesar Cipher Algorithm to encrypt/decrypt plain text. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter with a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

## Encrypt plain text
- [Source Code](./encrypt.cpp)

## Decrypt Plain text
- [Source code](./decrypt.cpp)
