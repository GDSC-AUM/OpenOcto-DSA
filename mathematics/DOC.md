## Factorial of a Number

- [Source code](./factorial_of_n.cpp)

- In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n:
`n! = n . (n-1) . (n-2) . (n-3) ...... 3 . 2 . 1`  
For example,  `5! = 5 . 4 . 3 . 2 . 1 = 120`  
The value of `0!` is `1`, according to the convention for an empty product. [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial)]
