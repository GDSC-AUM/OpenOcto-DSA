## Factorial of a Number

- [Source code](./factorial_of_n.cpp)

- In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n:
`n! = n . (n-1) . (n-2) . (n-3) ...... 3 . 2 . 1`  
For example,  `5! = 5 . 4 . 3 . 2 . 1 = 120`  
The value of `0!` is `1`, according to the convention for an empty product. [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial)]

## Prime Factors of a Number

- [Source code](./prime_factors_of_n.cpp)

- In mathematics, factors of a non-negative integer n, are positive integers less than n which completely divides n,i.e., they leave remainder 0 when n is divided by them. Prime factors of a number n are factors of n which are prime numbers.

### For example: 
<pre>
    Factors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15
    Prime Factors of 30 are 2, 3, 5
</pre>

## Sieve of eratosthenes

- [Source code](./sieve_or_eratosthenes.cpp)

- Prime numbers are those natural numbers that are divisible by only 1 and themselves. Sieve of eratosthenes is a famous effecient algorithm to find all the prime numbers less than equal to a given number **n**.

### For example: 
<pre>
    Prime numbers less than equal to 30 are 
    2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29
    Count of primes less than equal to 30 is 10
