# Strings

## Print Permutations of String

- [Source Code](./print_permutations.cpp)

- Takes a string from user and print its all possible permutations

- Simple algorithm that pushes every character to an empty string, and then recursively calls itself to permute on remaining string. The recursion base case is, when all the characters of input string are pushed to the originally empty string. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation)
